`estaleiro` allows you to build container images with confidence - a declarative
approach to dealing with the last mile in building container images.

### problem set

`Dockerfile`s are great - they allow us to do anything!

With that power, problems arise when an entire organization starts adopting it:

- no control over base images
- some drop user privileges, others don't
- artifacts can end up in them coming from who knows where
  - with which versions?
  - having the source code from where?


### buildkit

- TODO: how to do it on macos


### LICENSE
