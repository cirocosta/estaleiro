`estaleiro` allows you to ship container images with confidence - a declarative
approach to dealing with the last mile in building container images, so you can
have more control (through transparency) over what you ship.

### problem set



Keeping track of what has been added to a container image that one is about to
ship if hard.

With the versatility of Dockerfiles, it's quite easy to shoot itself in the foot
when it comes to either installing dependencies that one couldn't even consume,
or that wouldn't be wise.

While it's great to talk about best practices, it's hard to enforce them.



### estaleiro

`estaleiro` leverages [`buildkit`](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) as a way of
implementing a convention of how the last stage in building a container image
(i.e., gathering binaries built in previous steps), putting guard-rails where
needed, and enforcing a set of rules where needed.

Here's an example of how that looks like in practice:

1. bring your Dockerfile that you've already been using to build your binary

```Dockerfile
FROM golang AS base

	ENV CGO_ENABLED=0
	RUN apt update && apt install -y git

	ADD . /src
	WORKDIR /src

	RUN go mod download


FROM base AS build

	RUN go build \
		-tags netgo -v -a \
		-o /usr/local/bin/estaleiro \
		-ldflags "-X main.version=$(cat ./VERSION) -extldflags \"-static\""
```

2. bring a `estaleiro` file that describes how to package that binary produced

```hcl
# syntax = cirocosta/estaleiro-frontend

# the final image to produce
#
image "cirocosta/estaleiro" {
  base_image {
    name = "ubuntu"
    ref  = "bionic"
  }
  
  apt {
    package "ca-certificates" {}
  }

  file "/usr/local/bin/estaleiro" {
    from_step "build" {
      path = "/bin/estaleiro"
    }
  }
}


# performs the build of `estaleiro`.
#
step "build" {
  dockerfile = "./Dockerfile"
  target     = "build"

  source_file "/bin/estaleiro" {
    vcs "git" {
      ref        = "${estaleiro-commit}"
      repository = "https://github.com/cirocosta/estaleiro"
    }
  }
}
```

Having those pieces in, `estaleiro` creates the intermediary representation to
be used by `buildkitd` to build the final container image that starts from
`ubuntu:bionic`, has the `ca-certificates` package installed, and the file that
the Dockerfile built - all while keeping track of their versions and sources
along the way in the form of a bill of materials:

### how to use

**THIS IS STILL HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL**

All that you need is:

- Docker 18.09+

Having an `estaleiro` file (like the `estaleiro.hcl` that you find in this
repo), direct `docker build` to it via a regular `--file` (`-f`), having
`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` set as the environent variable:

```console
# create an `estaleiro.hcl` file.
# 
# note.: the first line (with syntax ...) is important - it's
#        what tells the docker engine to fetch our implementation
#        of `estaleiro`, responsible for creating the build
#        definition.
#
$ echo "# syntax=cirocosta/estaleiro
image "cirocosta/sample" {
  base_image {
    name = "ubuntu"
    ref  = "bionic"
  }
}
" > ./estaleiro.hcl


# instruct `docker` to build our image
#
$ docker build -t test -f ./estaleiro.hcl
[+] Building 9.4s (4/4) FINISHED


# retrieve the bill of materials from the filesystem
#
$ docker create --name tmp
$ docker cp tmp:/bom/merged.yml ./bom.yml
```
