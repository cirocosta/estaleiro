	- just started perf testing
	- trouble with `yaml` anchors?
	  	what's that about?

		> we should perhaps document this

	- happy with the rebalancing :D
	- didn't try the new container placement strategy yet
		- having to restart web nodes in some cases
		- direction on the ratio
		- knowing when to properly scale


	- give them references to the issues that we've been working on
	  regarding web nodes having to be restarted

	  	https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3928

	  

	two issues:
		- jobs pending
		- jobs not even going to pending

			--> give them a link to the new sched alg work
