APT-KEYS

	apt-key is used to manage the list of keys used by apt to authenticate packages.
	Packages which have been authenticated using these keys will be considered
	trusted.

	As just leveraging the standard Ubuntu repositories is not enough in
	some cases (e.g., to install `docker-ce`), it ends up being necessary
	trusting other servers that have not been trusted yet by the distro that
	we leverage.
