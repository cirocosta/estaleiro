REPOSITORIES


	RIGHT NOW

		- we have a "standard" set of debian repositories that is used to form our package
		  listing, including only supported packages.



	FUTURE

		- allow the user to have more than just those.


		```hcl
		image "dahiu" {
			apt {

				repositories = [
					"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic universe"
					"deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic universe"
				]

				package "jq" {}

			}
		}
		```
