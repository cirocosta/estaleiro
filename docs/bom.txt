BOM GENERATION


	PACKAGES

		- [ ] list all of the packages that are there in the base image
		      right in the beginning

			(i.e., gather all from `base image`)

			> read file `/var/lib/dpkg/status`

		

		- [ ] for each package installed
			
			- gather their corresponding `apt-cache policy` result


				policies := llb.Scratch()
				state.AddMount(policies, "/policies")

				for _, pkg := range packages {
					apt-cache policy pkg >> /policies/policies
				}


		- [ ] (internal) image to generate `packages.yml` BOM ?
			reads `/policies` and then prepares `packages.yml`?

			*--> 	if we had a way of performing the builds ourselves
				without the use of `buildctl`, mayba that would
				make things simpler, leveraging `ref` :thinking:
